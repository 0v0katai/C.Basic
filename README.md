# C.Basic version archive branch

This is the archive branch for documenting all changes made to C.Basic, from the first version (FX 0.10) released in 2015, up until FX 2.47-β2/CG 1.47-β2. Click the `Commits` button above to view the changes for a specific version.

Starting from FX 2.48/CG 1.48 (tentative naming), all changes will be commited to the main branch.

Note that the version build numbers used in some of the commit messages have been revised and may be different from the ones assigned in their coresponding AddinInfo.txt.

All version changes are uploaded as-is, with the exception of the following ones:

Version         | Description
---             | ---
FX 00.10.0000   | Uncompilable due to missing CB.sample.c, but the file was patched and fx-9860G SDK is now able to compile the version with exactly the same content as the original source.
FX 00.99.1501   | Partial source files were recovered from the corrupted source package.
