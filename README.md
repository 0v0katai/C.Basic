# C.Basic - CASIO Basic IDE for fx-9860 and fx-CG calculators

C.Basic ("c-dot-basic") is the reference implementation of CASIO Basic, written in CASIO SDK for fx-9860 and miniSDK for fx-CG calculators.

The add-in lets you incorporate SDK-exclusive features to your CASIO Basic programs in calculator, without having to worry about the cumbersome debugging environment of C/C++.

C.Basic has only implemented the interpreter part in the current phase. In the future, C.Basic will evolve into C:Basic ("c-colon-basic") which includes a compiler.

## Supported calculators

Edition | Calculators
---     | ---
FX      | fx-9750GIII/9860 series, Graph 35+EII/75/85/95
CG      | fx-CG series, Graph 90+E

## Features

* Achieve add-in like performance with little to no modifications to existing CASIO Basic programs
* Access and edit programs directly in SMEM and SD card
* Robust editor with features from modern IDE â€” syntax highlighting, indentation, variable/matrix lookup and debugging
* Extended commands with CASIO Basic style syntax
* Emulate G1M runtime environment in fx-CG calculators

## Things to know

* If you are an fx-CG10 or fx-CG20 user, C.Basic will ask whether you want it to overclock your calculator to match the performance of an fx-CG50.
    * The mechanic is based on [Ptune2](https://gitea.planet-casio.com/CalcLoverHK/Ftune-Ptune), an overclocking add-in made by the same author of C.Basic. Upon agreement, C.Basic will increase your processor core clock (IFC) from 58.98 MHz to 117.96 MHz.
    * Please keep in mind that damage caused by overclocking (and using this add-in) will not be covered by CASIO's warranty.
    * You can disable this prompt in the settings at anytime.
* As C.Basic uses floating point to express numbers instead of binary-coded decimal that CASIO Basic uses, handling non-integers calculations may cause approximation errors. You are advised not to use C.Basic for applications involving serious calculations.
* Please note that the file manager of C.Basic is not yet optimized with calculators featuring Fugue filesystem. See [#1](https://gitea.planet-casio.com/CalcLoverHK/C.Basic/issues/1) for more details.
