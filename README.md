# C.Basic - Casio Basic IDE add-in for fx-9860 and fx-CG graphing calculators

C.Basic (pronounce "c-dot-basic") is the reference implementation of Casio Basic, written in Casio SDK for fx-9860 and miniSDK for fx-CG calculators.

The add-in lets you incorporate SDK-exclusive features to your Casio Basic programs in calculator, without having to worry about the cumbersome debugging environment of C/C++.

C.Basic has only implemented the interpreter part in the current phase. In the future, C.Basic will evolve into C:Basic ("c-colon-basic") which includes a compiler.

## Supported calculators

* *FX Edition*
    * fx-9860 series
    * fx-9750GIII
    * Graph 75/85/95 series
    * Graph 35+E II
* *CG Edition*
    * fx-CG series
    * Graph 90+E

## Features

* Achieve add-in like performance with little to no modifications to existing Casio Basic programs
* Access and edit programs directly in SMEM and SD card
* Robust editor with features from modern IDE â€” syntax highlighting, indentation, variable/matrix lookup and debugging
* Extended commands with Casio Basic style syntax
* Emulate G1M runtime environment in fx-CG calculators

## Things to know

* If you are an fx-CG10 or fx-CG20 user, C.Basic will ask whether you want it to overclock your calculator to match the performance of an fx-CG50.
    * The mechanic is based on [Ptune2](https://pm.matrix.jp/ftune2e.html), an overclocking add-in made by the same author of C.Basic. Upon agreement, C.Basic will increase your processor core clock (IFC) from 58.98 MHz to 117.96 MHz.
    * While this overclocking preset is proven to be stable in our test cases, please keep in mind that damage caused by overclocking (and using this add-in) will not be covered by Casio's warranty.
    * You can disable this prompt in the settings at anytime.
* As C.Basic is written in C/C++, it uses floating point to express numbers instead of binary-coded decimal that Casio Basic uses. As such, handling non-integers may cause numerical errors. You are advised not to use C.Basic for applications involving serious calculations.
* Please note that the file manager of C.Basic is not yet optimized with calculators featuring Fugue filesystem. See [#1](https://gitea.planet-casio.com/CalcLoverHK/C.Basic/issues/1) for more details.
