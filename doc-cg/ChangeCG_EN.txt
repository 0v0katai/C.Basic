                  <Processing for error2>
                 TryEnd
        If there is no error in <program>, processing moves after TryEnd.
        If error1 occurs, processing will move after TryEnd after executing <Process for error1>.
        If error2 occurs, processing will move after TryEnd after executing <Process for error2>.
        When Error3 occurs, an error pop-up appears because there is no corresponding Except.

        (Format) Except
        If there is no Except corresponding to an error, "Error" is executed because Except with no argument corresponds to all errors.

        (Example) Try 3*4+
                  Except 1
                   "Syntax Error"
                  TryEnd
        "Syntax Error" is executed, since SyntaxError error code is 1.

        (Example) Try 3*4/0
                  Except 1
                   "Syntax Error"
                  Except 40
                   "Divide by Zero"
                  TryEnd
        “Divide by Zero”is executed, since division by zero error code is 40.

        (Example) Try 3*4/0
                  Except 1
                   "Syntax Error"
                  Except
                   "Error"
                  TryEnd
        If there is no Except corresponding to an error, "Error" is executed because Except with no argument corresponds to all errors.

        The sample program is in CBasic_sample/Try_Except.
        Refer to ErrorCode_List.txt for the error code.

        -added setting not to initialize Mat&List at start of C.Basic at use hidden RAM. (setup setting required)
         In that case, when you finish C.Basic and restart after use in other functions or add-in, Mat&List will restored.
         (when other add-in does not use hidden RAM)
        -Fixed the number key in that not able to input in MENU command.


v1.4beta        2017.4.16
        -supported the multiplication of the Matrix.
        The multiplication between the Mat sequence that considered Mat to be array is possible by doing it for multiplication between List by using the small letter Mat.
        Substance agreed with (List with small letter Mat;)

        -Fixed incompatibility that returned to main menu with [MENU] key during Menu command practice.
        -in StrMid command, Fixed malfunction to become the system error when third parameter.


v1.2beta        2017.3.17
        -Part of operation of the sequence (line) was enabled by extension of the addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operation on the list.
         As for the one which there is which is compatible with a pure line, it is only with the addition and subtraction between lines and a line and scalar operation.
         (example) Mat A + Mat B
         (example) Mat A * B + Int Mat C

        -Fixed compatibility of BG-None,BG-Pict command.

        -Fixed conversion error of Exp(-) in the conversion from a text source.

        -Fixed #'CBINT ,#'CBDBL was programing it and revised plural malfunction not to function when it was used.
        -Fixed a text conversion error of the string that "Char" was included in.
        -When set Pict in the heap area, read it automatically when there was Pict picture file of same No in current directory or Pict folder.
         When set it, only the Pict folder of the current drive accesses the S.Mem in Pict.
        (example) If there is Pict10.g1m file in current directory or Pict folder, the image is read automatically in the Pict of the heap when accessed it first in Pict10.
                  When do not exist, it becomes the memory error.
                  When the image exists, it becomes only heap access from next Pict10 access.

        -added function that confirm the image when push [EXE] with Pict file with the filelist screen.
        -Fixed incompatibility that passed the loop when initial value exceeded  closing value in For-Next command.

         TθMax
         TθPtch

        -added the delete command of the file.
        (example) Delete "TEST.txt"
         delete "TEST.txt".
        (example) Delete "TEST.txt", 1
         confirm it before deletion.

        -Fixed that (JUMP) jump sub menu [F6] skip down did not work [F1] in the debugging mode.
        -Fixed that what the closing value of the control variable exceeded in For-Next command.
        -Values of Ans always merged it in the genuie specifications not to update Ans when there was (->) substitution when it followed of the expression.
        -in the space of the head of a line, Fixed malfunction to become the error before one of Then of the If-Then command in the case of space.
        -Fixed the malfunction that appeared when there was loop structure in a party [AC], and a break did not work for.
          (example) While Getkey<>31:WhileEnd
        -FixedI the malfunction not to be finished by Stop command in the sub program.
        -Changed the default line used for a string variable from s (small letter) to r of one of an additional variable.
        -added the wait function to slow an overall execution speed. set it by setup and [Wait] command.
         When set it by setup, all the programs are affected.
         (example) Wait 100
         Even SH3 is SH4A, but becomes the speed drop of the same.
         Wait 10  is about 1/2  speed.
         Wait 100 is about 1/10 speed.

2nd Feb, 2017
Ver. 1.00 - beta 7 version

        - New Feature [2nd Feb, 2017]: Newly support alias variables by adding AliasVar command. Any character can be used as alias of actual variable character.
          Maximum 10 aliases can be used.
          Replacable variables are single letter variables shown charactors page by [CHAR].
          Variable name and matrix name are replaced by alias at the same time.
         (example) AliasVar A=(alpha)
                  (alpha)+100->(alpha)
          After setting the alias (alpha), (alpha) is available as variable insead of variable A. Real entity of (alpha) is A, so the above expresisono is identical with A+100->A



2nd Feb, 2017
Ver. 1.00 - beta 6 version

        - New Feature [2nd Feb, 2017]: Newly support variable r and θ as same as genuine Casio Basic. As an extended feature of C.Basic r and θ can be used local variable as well as global.
         These new variables r and θ can be used for matrix name, so descrition such as θ1, θ5 (abbreviation of matrix expression) can be used.
        - New Feature [2nd Feb, 2017]: Newly support fraction character (operator) "/" (line mode).



29st Jan, 2017
Ver. 1.00 - beta 5a version

        - Bug Fix [29th Jan, 2017]: In SD version, navigation in File List Page was slow. This is hopefully fixed (may not be...).



26st Jan, 2017
Ver. 1.00 - beta 5 version (hopefully supporting SD)

         Note) This version is for trial to support SD version of fx-9860G Sries. Develper team do not have SD version of these calcs and did not check with real calc yet. We appreciate any feedback from useres.

        - Spec Change [26th Jan, 2017]: Text file handing spec is changed. Text file could not be saved. When tried to save text file, the file was autoatically converted to g1m file and then saved as g1m file. This spec is now changed, text file can be separately handled from g1m file.
         If tou wan to save text file with automatically converted g1m file, set "Force g1m save" on in Setup Page.
         With this new spec, you can enjoy C.Basic with only text file.

        - Bug Fix [26th Jan, 2017]: Bugs in copy and renamne of text file is fixed.
        - Bug Fix [26th Jan, 2017]: g1m file including a long string in multiple lines within " " failed converting to text file, special charactors could not properly converting to text. This is fixed.
        - New Feature [26st Jan, 2017]: When use graphic drawing commands (genuine Casio Basic commands), set "@" right after one of those commands to allow drawing in current VRAM, regardless text or graphic mode.
         (example) Locate 2,2,"String"
                   Text 16,1,"TextString"
         The Text command draw in text VRAM, not in graphic mode.

        - Spec Change [26th Jan, 2017]: FkeyMenu(, ReadGraph( and WriteGraph commands draw in current VRAM. It depended on VRAM mode, but is changed.
        - New Feature [26st Jan, 2017]: A new key scan command KeyRow( is added.

             returing bits (in binary)

            02    1     2    3    +    -             02
            01    0     .    EXP  (-)  EXE           01
           Row--------------------------------------Row

         (example) KeyRow(9)
           When press [F4] and [F6] keys at the same time, bit3 and bit1 come to 1, then return value is 2^3 + 2^1 = 10.

        - New Feature [26th Jan, 2017]: A new command Menu (same as genuine Casio Basic) is added.


25st Jan, 2017
Ver. 1.00 - beta 3 version (hopefully supporting SD)

         Note) This version is for trial to support SD version of fx-9860G Sries. Develper team do not have SD version of these calcs and did not check with real calc yet. We appreciate any feedback  from useres.

        - Bug Fix [25th Jan, 2017]: StrLeft did not work. this is fixed.
        - Bug Fix [25th Jan, 2017]: An expression ScreenG in manual and sample program was wring. This should be Screen.G (needed a dot). this is fixed.
        - Bug Fix [21st Jan, 2017]: When SD capacity is 4GB or more, an indication of memory free was wrong. This is fixed.
        - New Feature [20th Jan, 2017]: In SD version calcs, g1m files in SD card can be run and editedable.


25th Jan, 2017
Ver. 1.00 - beta version

        - Bug Fix [25th Jan, 2017]: StrLeft did not work. this is fixed.
        - Bug Fix [25th Jan, 2017]: An expression ScreenG in manual and sample program was wring. This should be Screen.G (needed a dot). this is fixed.
        - Improveent [19th Jan, 2017]: When font charactor is drawn by Text comamnd, top 1 pixel line was cleared. This is not compatible with genuine Casio Basic because Casio Basic uses 6 dots height for font, but C.Basic used 7 dots heighet for font (due to specification of PrintMini() function of Casio SDK). This is improved to be compatible with genuine Casio Basic.
        - Bug Fix [18th Jan, 2017]: _Vertical was enbuged. this is fixed.
        - Bug Fix [18th Jan, 2017]: In fx-9860GII OS2.09, system error may occur at starting of program. This is fixed.
        - Bug Fix [17th Jan, 2017]: Small letter matrix abbreviation (a[1], a2, etc) cannot be used. This is fixed.
        - Improvement [17th Jan, 2017]: Uasage of String variable Str is extended. When start index (of charactor array) is 0 (zero), an expression "Str 0" is now available.
         (example) '#Mat 0
           "String"->Str 0
        - New Feature [17th Jan, 2017]: Add new function MatBase( that returns start index of matrix.
         (example) '#Mat 0
             0->Mat A
             MatBase( Mat A )
           this returns 0 (zero).
        - Bug Fix [17th Jan, 2017]: Comamnds that convert to text with use of ElemSize(, RowSize( and ColSize( as parameter did not properly work. This is fixed.
        - Improvement [17th Jan, 2017]:  Intermediate code of DotPut( and Sprintf( were same as genuine Casio Basic codes. The redundant codes of the extended commands are changed.
          DotPut( = DotP 0xF94B -> 0xF74B
          Sprintf( = Vct 0xF73E -> 0xF743

          C.Basic Ver 1.00 automatically corrects the redundancy of the intermediate codes when it reads old program created by older version, so you can properly execute or edit the modified program as usual.
          DotTrim( and  DotGet( are also automatically treated for the conversion in the same way.

        - New Feature [17th Jan, 2017]: C.Basic supports MonochromeLib "Ultra Fast Graphic Library for fx-9860G Series". See MonochromeLib Web Site for details. Following commands are available;
         _ClrVram
         _ClrScreen
         _DispVram
         _Pixel
         _Point
         _PixelTest(
         _Line
         _Horizontal
         _Vertical
         _Rectangle
         _Polygon
         _FillPolygon
         _Circle
         _FillCircle
         _Elips
         _FillElips
         _ElipsInRct
         _FElipsInRct
         _Hscroll
         _Vscroll
         _Bmp
         _Bmp8
         _Bmp16

          This ML commans access hardware indepententy from Casio Basic commands and are totally deferent command system.
          These comamnds operate current VRAM, so VRAM data should be transferred to LDC (LCD refreshing) is required in oorder to display the drawing result by use of PutoDispDD or other equivalent commands.
          See manual (this will be prepared in English shortly) to use the ML commands. Some simple sample programs are included in ML_sample folder.


11th Jan, 2017
Ver. 0.99v - alpha version

        - New Feature [11th Jan, 2017]: When actual matrix substance for A0 ~ A9 allocated and also try accessing to A0 ~ A9, the matrix substance is automatically allocated.
         (example) A1+123→B5
          Since Mat A and Mat B are not alocated yet at timing of access to the variables A1 and B1, followings are automatically carried out
           9→Dim A
           9→Dim B
         then A1 ~ A9 and B1 ~ B9 come to be ready to use.

         (example)
          '#Mat 0
          A1+123→B5
          Since Mat A and Mat B are not alocated yet at timing of access to the variables A1 and B5,
          10→Dim A
          10→Dim B
         are automatically carried out and then A0~A9 and B0~B9 come to be ready to use.

         (example)
          '#Mat 0
          2→Dim B
          A1+123→B5
         since Mat A is not allocated and size of Mat B is allocated,
          10→Dim A
         are automatically carried out but size of Mat B is smaller than Mat A, so accessing to B5 gives Error. Then A0~A9 and B-~B5 come to be ready to use.

        - New Feature [9th Jan, 2017]: New feature to access to matrix by suffix 0 (zero) is added with a condition. Suffix 0 can be used for only matrix which is set to use 0 for first index. You can set the start index as 0 in Set Up page or by matrix initialization by '#Mat 0.

          Matrix      Array    Variable
          A[0,0]      A[0]      A0
          A[1,0]      A[1]      A1
          A[2,0]      A[2]      A2
          A[3,0]      A[3]      A3
          A[4,0]      A[4]      A4
