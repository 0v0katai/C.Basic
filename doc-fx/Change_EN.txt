* Added error value indicator on the bottom-left corner of error prompt
* Added git commit hash to version pop-up

# Changes
* Compilation tool changes:
    - Switched SDK from Casio to fxSDK
    - Switched compiler from SHC to GCC 14.1
    - Up to 18% performance uplift
    - Approximately 50 kB add-in size reduction
* The save format of half-width katakana characters in text file is switched from Shift-JIS to FONTCHARACTER
* Input in C.Basic catalog menu is now always in alpha-lock mode
* `MOD(` no longer rounds off inputs
* `LCM(` now accepts negative arguments instead of raising `Argument ERROR`
* Extended the range of unique integers of `RanInt#(` from 2^15 to 2^31
* Error message changes:
    - `Not Loop ERROR` -> `Not in Loop`
    - `No Matrix Array` -> `Undefined Matrix`
    - `Invalid Ary Size` -> `Invalid Size`

        (Format) Try <program>
                 Except error code 1
                  <Processing for error1>
                 Except error code 2
                  <Processing for error2>
                 TryEnd
        If there is no error in <program>, processing moves after TryEnd.
        If error1 occurs, processing will move after TryEnd after executing <Process for error1>.
        If error2 occurs, processing will move after TryEnd after executing <Process for error2>.
        When Error3 occurs, an error pop-up appears because there is no corresponding Except.

        (Format) Except
        If there is no Except corresponding to an error, "Error" is executed because Except with no argument corresponds to all errors.

        (Example) Try 3*4+
                  Except 1
                   "Syntax Error"
                  TryEnd
        "Syntax Error" is executed, since SyntaxError error code is 1.

        (Example) Try 3*4/0
                  Except 1
                   "Syntax Error"
                  Except 40
                   "Divide by Zero"
                  TryEnd
        “Divide by Zero”is executed, since division by zero error code is 40.

        (Example) Try 3*4/0
                  Except 1
                   "Syntax Error"
                  Except
                   "Error"
                  TryEnd
        If there is no Except corresponding to an error, "Error" is executed because Except with no argument corresponds to all errors.

        The sample program is in CBasic_sample/Try_Except.
        Refer to ErrorCode_List.txt for the error code.

        -When set Pict in the heap area, read it automatically when there was Pict picture file of same No in current directory or Pict folder.
         When set it, only the Pict folder of the current drive accesses the S.Mem in Pict.
        (example) If there is Pict10.g1m file in current directory or Pict folder, the image is read automatically in the Pict of the heap when accessed it first in Pict10.
                  When do not exist, it becomes the memory error.
                  When the image exists, it becomes only heap access from next Pict10 access.

        (example) Delete "TEST.txt", 1
         confirm it before deletion.

        -Fixed that (JUMP) jump sub menu [F6] skip down did not work [F1] in the debugging mode.
        -Fixed that what the closing value of the control variable exceeded in For-Next command.
        -Values of Ans always merged it in the genuie specifications not to update Ans when there was (->) substitution when it followed of the expression.
        -in the space of the head of a line, Fixed malfunction to become the error before one of Then of the If-Then command in the case of space.
        -Fixed the malfunction that appeared when there was loop structure in a party [AC], and a break did not work for.
          (example) While GetKey<>31:WhileEnd
        -FixedI the malfunction not to be finished by Stop command in the sub program.
        -Changed the default line used for a character string variable from s (small letter) to r of one of an additional variable.
        -added the wait function to slow an overall execution speed. set it by setup and [Wait] command.
         When set it by setup, all the programs are affected.
         (example) Wait 100
         Even SH3 is SH4A, but becomes the speed drop of the same.
         Wait 10  is about 1/2  speed.
         Wait 100 is about 1/10 speed.

2nd Feb, 2017
Ver. 1.00 - beta 7 version

        - New Feature [2nd Feb, 2017]: Newly support alias variables by adding AliasVar command. Any character can be used as alias of actual variable character.
          Maximum 10 aliases can be used.
          Replacable variables are single letter variables shown charactors page by [CHAR].
          Variable name and matrix name are replaced by alias at the same time.
         (example) AliasVar A=(alpha)
                  (alpha)+100->(alpha)
          After setting the alias (alpha), (alpha) is available as variable insead of variable A. Real entity of (alpha) is A, so the above expresisono is identical with A+100->A



2nd Feb, 2017
Ver. 1.00 - beta 6 version

        - New Feature [2nd Feb, 2017]: Newly support variable r and θ as same as genuine Casio Basic. As an extended feature of C.Basic r and θ can be used local variable as well as global.
         These new variables r and θ can be used for matrix name, so descrition such as θ1, θ5 (abbreviation of matrix expression) can be used.
        - New Feature [2nd Feb, 2017]: Newly support fraction character (operator) "/" (line mode).



29st Jan, 2017

        - Bug Fix [26th Jan, 2017]: g1m file including a long string in multiple lines within " " failed converting to text file, special charactors could not properly converting to text. This is fixed.
        - New Feature [26st Jan, 2017]: When use graphic drawing commands (genuine Casio Basic commands), set "@" right after one of those commands to allow drawing in current VRAM, regardless text or graphic mode.
         (example) Locate 2,2,"String"
                   Text 16,1,"TextString"
         The Text command draw in text VRAM, not in graphic mode.

        - Spec Change [26th Jan, 2017]: FkeyMenu(, ReadGraph( and WriteGraph commands draw in current VRAM. It depended on VRAM mode, but is changed.
        - New Feature [26st Jan, 2017]: A new key scan command KeyRow( is added.

        - Bug Fix [25th Jan, 2017]: An expression ScreenG in manual and sample program was wring. This should be Screen.G (needed a dot). this is fixed.
        - Improveent [19th Jan, 2017]: When font charactor is drawn by Text comamnd, top 1 pixel line was cleared. This is not compatible with genuine Casio Basic because Casio Basic uses 6 dots height for font, but C.Basic used 7 dots heighet for font (due to specification of PrintMini() function of Casio SDK). This is improved to be compatible with genuine Casio Basic.
        - Bug Fix [18th Jan, 2017]: _Vertical was enbuged. this is fixed.

           this returns 0 (zero).
        - Bug Fix [17th Jan, 2017]: Comamnds that convert to text with use of ElemSize(, RowSize( and ColSize( as parameter did not properly work. This is fixed.
        - Improvement [17th Jan, 2017]:  Intermediate code of DotPut( and Sprintf( were same as genuine Casio Basic codes. The redundant codes of the extended commands are changed.
          DotPut( = DotP 0xF94B -> 0xF74B
          Sprintf( = Vct 0xF73E -> 0xF743

          C.Basic Ver 1.00 automatically corrects the redundancy of the intermediate codes when it reads old program created by older version, so you can properly execute or edit the modified program as usual.
          DotTrim( and  DotGet( are also automatically treated for the conversion in the same way.

        - New Feature [17th Jan, 2017]: C.Basic supports MonochromeLib "Ultra Fast Graphic Library for fx-9860G Series". See MonochromeLib Web Site for details. Following commands are available;
         _ClrVram
         _ClrScreen
         _DispVram
         _Pixel
         _Point
         _PixelTest(
         _Line
         _Horizontal
         _Vertical
         _Rectangle
         _Polygon
         _FillPolygon
         _Circle
         _FillCircle
         _Elips
         _FillElips
         _ElipsInRct
         _FElipsInRct
         _Hscroll
         _Vscroll
         _Bmp
         _Bmp8
         _Bmp16

          This ML commans access hardware indepententy from Casio Basic commands and are totally deferent command system.
          These comamnds operate current VRAM, so VRAM data should be transferred to LDC (LCD refreshing) is required in oorder to display the drawing result by use of PutoDispDD or other equivalent commands.
          See manual (this will be prepared in English shortly) to use the ML commands. Some simple sample programs are included in ML_sample folder.


11th Jan, 2017
Ver. 0.99v - alpha version

        - New Feature [11th Jan, 2017]: When actual matrix substance for A0 ~ A9 allocated and also try accessing to A0 ~ A9, the matrix substance is automatically allocated.
         (example) A1+123→B5
          Since Mat A and Mat B are not alocated yet at timing of access to the variables A1 and B1, followings are automatically carried out
           9→Dim A
           9→Dim B
         then A1 ~ A9 and B1 ~ B9 come to be ready to use.

         (example)
          '#Mat 0
          A1+123→B5
          Since Mat A and Mat B are not alocated yet at timing of access to the variables A1 and B5,
          10→Dim A
          10→Dim B
         are automatically carried out and then A0~A9 and B0~B9 come to be ready to use.

         (example)
          '#Mat 0
          2→Dim B
          A1+123→B5
         since Mat A is not allocated and size of Mat B is allocated,
          10→Dim A
         are automatically carried out but size of Mat B is smaller than Mat A, so accessing to B5 gives Error. Then A0~A9 and B-~B5 come to be ready to use.

        - New Feature [9th Jan, 2017]: New feature to access to matrix by suffix 0 (zero) is added with a condition. Suffix 0 can be used for only matrix which is set to use 0 for first index. You can set the start index as 0 in Set Up page or by matrix initialization by '#Mat 0.

          Matrix      Array    Variable
          A[0,0]      A[0]      A0
          A[1,0]      A[1]      A1
          A[2,0]      A[2]      A2
          A[3,0]      A[3]      A3
          A[4,0]      A[4]      A4
          A[5,0]      A[5]      A5
          A[6,0]      A[6]      A6
          A[7,0]      A[7]      A7
          A[8,0]      A[8]      A8
          A[9,0]      A[9]      A9

         (example)
          '#Mat 0
          10→Dim A
          10→A1
          20→A2
          A1+A2

        - New Feature [8th Jan, 2017]: New feature to access to matrix is added. In order to use a matrix as an array, we can use A[0] instead of A[0,1]. Now we can use A0 instead of A[0,1] as a new  feature.
           Matrix      Array    Variable
          A[1,1]      A[1]      A1
          A[2,1]      A[2]      A2
          A[3,1]      A[3]      A3
          A[4,1]      A[4]      A4
          A[5,1]      A[5]      A5
          A[6,1]      A[6]      A6
          A[7,1]      A[7]      A7
          A[8,1]      A[8]      A8
          A[9,1]      A[9]      A9

         (example)
          '#Mat 1
          10→Dim A
          10→A1
          20→A2
          A1+A2

15th Dec, 2016
Ver. 0.99s - alpha version

        Caution: Some source file created in Ver0.99r or earlier may have problem in Ver0.99s due to bug fix, but this problem can be solved by proper procedure. ⇒ see more for details
        - Bug Fix [15th Dec, 2016]: In Integer Mode, Sprintf did not accept display of real number. This bug is fixed.
         (example) Sprintf("A=%3.2f",#12.345)
        - Spec Change [14th Dec, 2016]: Evaluation of Real Number expression by prefix # in Sprintf, Locate and Text is changed. In Integer Mode variables are still in integer.
          Before the change: The evaluation of expression are done in real number, then integer variable requires to add %.
          After the change: The evaluation of expression is done in real number but variables are treated as integer then % is not required to be added.
        - Bug Fix [14th Dec, 2016]: When "Save File Nmae?" pops up by [EXIT] key after editing of your source, back groud is irrelevant to the edited source. This bug is fixed.
        - Bug Fix [13th Dec, 2016]: Prefix # in Real Number Mode did not work, then fixed.
         (example) #123.56+100
        - New command [13th Dec, 2016]: Disp
         (example) Disp A
          Disp display as same as (disps) does, but does not halt the program.
        - Bug Fix [13th Dec, 2016]: An intermediate code of "RefreshCtrl" was wrong, then fixed.
         RefreshCtrl = DotG : 0xF7F9 -> 0xF7F8
        - Bug Fix [13th Dec, 2016]: An intermediate code of "DotTrim(" and "DotGet(" was wrong, used same code of "Dot" and "DotG" in genuin Casio Basic. Then changed the code of "DotTrim(" and "DotGet(", fixed.
         DotGet( = DotG : 0xF73F -> 0xF73E
         DotTrim( = Dot : 0xF74F -> 0xF73D



24th Jul, 2016
Ver. 0.99r - alpha version

        - Improvement [24th Jul, 2016]: When hidden RAM area is run out, new area can be secured from heal area.
        - Bug Fix [21st Jul, 2016]: When hiden RAM is set to use and matrix cannot be allocated, a recovery process for this case was wrong, then fixed.
        - Improvement [20th Jul, 2016]: Hidden RAM feature is implemented and this can be allocated for program and matrix.
          Memory size allocated for program and matrix is totally 265KB.
          File List buffer is fixed in heap area.
        - Improvement [20th Jul, 2016]: Free area of storage memory and number of files are displayed in top of File List.
          The free area of storage memory is decreasing as saving program, doing copy or remane of files, so optimization of memory is required when the free area is getting less (good indicator for a timing of memory optomization).
        - Bug Fox [20th Jul, 2016]: ClrMat could not entirely delete a matrix, fixed.
        - Bug Fix [20th Jul, 206]: Function "Int" was mixed up with "Intg", so "Int" was fied and "Intg" was added.
